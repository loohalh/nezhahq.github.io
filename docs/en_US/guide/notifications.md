## Flexible notification methods 

In panel messages, the placeholder `#DATETIME#` represents the timestamp of when an event occurs. When the notification is triggered, the panel automatically replaces #DATETIME# with the actual time of the event.

`#NEZHA#` is the panel message placeholder, the panel will automatically replace the placeholder with the actual message when it triggers the notification    

The content of Body is in `JSON` format：**When the request type is FORM**，the value is in the form of `key:value`，`value` can contain placeholders that will be automatically replaced when notified. **When the request type is JSON** It will only do string substitution and submit to the `URL` directly.

Placeholders can also be placed inside the URL, and it will perform a simple string substitution when requested.


Refer to the example below, it is very flexible.

  - **Bark Example**
    - Name: Bark
    - URL: The first part is the key, followed by three matches/: key/: body or/: key/: title/: body or/: key/: category/: title/: body
    - Request method: GET
    - Request Type: Default
    - Body: null
    
    - Name: Bark
    - URL:/push
    - Request method: POST
    - Request type: FORM
    - Body: `{"title": "#SERVER.NAME#","device_key":"xxxxxxxxx","body":"#NEZHA#","icon":" https://xxxxxxxx/nz.png "}`

   - **Telegram Example, contributed by [@haitau](https://github.com/haitau)**

     - Name：Telegram Robot message notification
     - URL：https://api.telegram.org/botXXXXXX/sendMessage?chat_id=YYYYYY&text=#NEZHA#
     - Request method: GET
     - Request type: default
     - Body: null
     - Notes for this method：The XXXXXX in botXXXXXX is the token provided when you follow the official @Botfather in Telegram and enter /newbot to create a new bot. (In the line after _Use this token to access the HTTP API_). The 'bot' are essential. After creating a bot, you need to talk to the BOT in Telegram (send a random message) before you can send a message by using API. YYYYYY is Telegram user's ID, you can get it by talking to the bot @userinfobot.    

  - **Email notification example - Outlook**   
     - Name: MS Mail Notification
     - URL：https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/microsoft.graph.sendMail
     - Request method: POST
     - Request type: JSON
     - Header: `{"Content-type":"application/json",
                  "Authorization":"Bearer {Token}"}`
     - Body:
    ```json
      {
        "message": {
            "subject": "Server Status Notification",
            "body": {
            "contentType": "Text",
            "content": "#NEZHA#"
            },
            "toRecipients": [
              {
                "emailAddress": {
                    "address": "ADDRESS FOR RECEVING EMAILS"
                    }
              }
            ]
        }
      } 
    ```

    Notes for this method: This method requires calling Microsoft Graph V1.0, you need to go to Microsoft Graph and create your own application, give `Mail.Send` permission and get the Token, or you can go [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) directly to give permission and get the Token, just replace the Token in the Header with the actual Token.

- **DingTalk Group bot notification Example**
    - Name: DingTalk Group
    - URL: https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=xxxxxxx

## Description of notification rules

### Basic Rules

- Type: one or more types can be selected, such as in a rule to select more than one type, you need to **meet all the selected types at the same time** to trigger the notification (see the example later)  
  - `cpu`、`memory`、`swap`、`disk`
  - `net_in_speed` Inbound speed, `net_out_speed` Outbound speed, `net_all_speed` Inbound + Outbound speed, `transfer_in` Inbound Transfer, `transfer_out` Outbound Transfer, `transfer_all` Total Transfer
  - `offline` Offline monitoring
  - `load1`、`load5`、`load15` Load
  - `process_count` Number of processes _Currently, counting the number of processes takes up too many resources and is not supported at the moment_
  - `tcp_conn_count`、`udp_conn_count` Number of connections
- duration：Lasting for a few seconds, the notification will only be triggered when the sampling record reaches 30% or more within a few seconds
- min/max
  - Transfer, network speed, and other values of the same type. Unit is byte (1KB=1024B，1MB = 1024\*1024B)
  - Memory, hard disk, CPU. units are usage percentages
  - No setup required for offline monitoring
- cover `[{"type":"offline","duration":10, "cover":0, "ignore":{"5": true}}]`
  - `0` Cover all, use `ignore` to ignore specific servers
  - `1` Ignore all, use `ignore` to monitoring specific servers  
  For example: `[{"type":"offline","duration":10, "cover":0, "ignore":{"5": true}}]`
- ignore:   Select to ignore specific servers, use with `cover` with server id and boolean, e.g.: `{"1": true, "2":false}`  

**Complete examples:**  

>>Add an offline notification
>
>   - Name: Offline notification
>   - Rules: `[{"Type":"offline","Duration":10}]`
>   - Enable: √



>>Add an notification when the CPU exceeds 50% for 10s **but** the memory usage is below 20% for 20s  
>
>   - Name: CPU and RAM
>   - Rules: `[{"Type":"cpu","Min":0,"Max":50,"Duration":10},{"Type":"memory","Min":20,"Max":0,"Duration":20}]`
>   - Enable: √  

>>Send specific server notifications to specific notification groups  
>
>Case:  
>You have four servers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and two different notification groups, A and B  
>1, 2 The two servers are down for 10 minutes and send a notification to Notification Group A  
>3, 4 These two servers are down for ten minutes and then send a notification to Notification Group B    
>
>First you need to set up two notification groups, A and B, and then add two alarm rules:    
>  
>**Rule I:**
>   - Name: 1, 2 Off-line, send notification to group A
>   - Rules:`[{"type":"offline","duration":600,"cover":1,"ignore":{"1":true,"2":true}}]`
>   - Notification group: A  
>   - Enable: √  
>
>**Rule II:**
>   - Name: 3, 4 Off-line, send notification to group B
>   - Rules:`[{"type":"offline","duration":600,"cover":1,"ignore":{"3":true,"4":true}}]`
>   - Notification group: B
>   - Enable: √  

**Using these rules flexibly will help you to make full use of the notification function**  

<br/> 

###  Special: Any-cycle transfer notification

Can be used as monthly transfer notificatin  

- type
  - `transfer_in_cycle` Inbound transfer during the cycle
  - `transfer_out_cycle` Outbound transfer during the cycle
  - `transfer_all_cycle` The sum of inbound and outbound transfer during the cycle

- `cycle_start` Start date of the statistical cycle (can be the start date of your server's billing cycle), the time format is RFC3339, for example, the format in Beijing time zone is `2022-01-11T08:00:00.00+08:00`
- `cycle_interval` Interval time cycle  (For example, if the cycle is in days and the value is 7, it means that the statistics are counted every 7 days)
- `cycle_unit` Statistics cycle unit, default `hour`, optional (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`)
- `min/max`, `cover`, `ignore` Please refer to the basic rules to configure

>Example:  
>>The servers with ID 3 and 4 (defined in the `ignore`) are counted on the 1st of each month, and a notification is triggered when the monthly outbound transfer reaches 1TB during the cycle.  
>
> `[{"type":"transfer_out_cycle","max":1099511627776,"cycle_start":"2022-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","cycle_interval":1,"cycle_unit":"month","cover":1,"ignore":{"3":true,"4":true}}]`

 ## Description of mode of triggering notification
- Always triggered: A notification is triggered each time the status reported by the Agent matches the rules of the notification  
- Triggered only once: only one notification is triggered when the state changes, such as changing from normal state to abnormal state or abnormal state back to normal state  

## Set the task to be executed when notification  
If you need to perform a task while sending a notification message, you can set those items  
+ `Tasks to be triggered in case of failure` The task to be executed when the notification status matches the change from "normal" to "failure", the task should be set in advance in the tasks page  
+ `Tasks to be triggered after fault recovery` The task to be executed when the notification status matches the change from " failure " to " normal ", the task should be set in advance in the tasks page
